                <q class="description">We want our country to be recognized with respect as a democratic nation in the world. The plans for the country should be centered around the people, not centered around any leader or party. We have witnessed the implementation of projects by the autocratic Hasina government that have squandered millions of unnecessary taxpayer money, which were never for the benefit of the people, but rather involved ugly self-interest and massive theft. We have already begun the process of scrutinizing all ongoing and proposed development projects. Considering the stage of project implementation, we will look for ways to reduce costs in the remaining works and will even consider canceling them if necessary. The people of the country will no longer be deceived. We will prioritize projects that create employment.</q>
